# puddlr: Analysis Tools for Shallow Datasets

## Functions
puddlr is a general-purpose set of tools for the analysis of datasets with
relatively few observations compared to the total number of features.  These
data sets are often called "shallow" and "wide", which is the inspiration
for the "puddlr" name.
